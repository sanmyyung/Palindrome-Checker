![The Code](https://github.com/sanmyyung/Palindrome-Checker/blob/main/palindrome.JPG)

## Introduction
This project involves the development of a Python program to check whether a string is a palindrome or not using AutoGPT. The purpose of this program is to determine if a given string reads the same forwards and backwards, which is useful in various applications such as data validation and string manipulation.

## Project Overview
The project consists of a Python script, 'Palindrome_checker.py', which was created using AutoGPT. This script accepts a string input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the string is a palindrome.

## Key Features
String Input: The program accepts a string input from the user.
Palindrome Check: The program checks if the input string reads the same forwards and backwards.
Output: The program outputs The string is a palindrome if the string is a palindrome and The string is not a palindrome if otherwise.
